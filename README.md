This repository contains several applications to support Kubernetes integration
with the CloudZero platform, including:

- _CloudZero Insights Controller_ - provides telemetry to the CloudZero platform
  to enabling complex cost allocation and analysis.
- _CloudZero Collector_ - the collector application exposes a prometheus remote
  write API which can receive POST requests from prometheus in either v1 or v2
  encoded format. It decodes the messages, then writes them to the `data`
  directory as parquet files with snappy compression.
- _CloudZero Shipper_ - the shipper application watches the data directory
  looking for completed parquet files on a regular interval (eg. 10 min), then
  will call the `CloudZero upload API` to allocate S3 Presigned PUT URLS. These
  URLs are used to upload the file. The application has the ability to compress
  the files before sending them to S3.
- _CloudZero Agent Validator_ - the validator application performs various
  validation checks.

## ‚ö° Getting Started With CloudZero Insights Controller

The easiest way to get started with the _CloudZero Insights Controller_ is by
using the `cloudzero-agent` Helm chart from the [cloudzero-charts
repository](https://github.com/Cloudzero/cloudzero-charts).

### Installation

See the [Installation Guide](./INSTALL.md) for details.

### Configuration

See the [Configuration Guide](./CONFIGURATION.md) for details.

###### Cleanup

```sh
make undeploy-admission-controller
make undeploy-test-app
```

### Debugging

The applications are based on a scratch container, so no shell is available. The
container images are less than 8MB.

To monitor the data directory, you must deploy a `debug` container as follows:

1. **Deploy a debug container**

   ```bash
   kubectl apply  -f cluster/deployments/debug/deployment.yaml
   ```

2. **Attach to the shell of the debug container**

   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it temp-shell -- /bin/sh
   ```

   To inspect the data directory, `cd /cloudzero/data`

---

### **Clean Up**

```bash
eksctl delete cluster -f cluster/cluster.yaml --disable-nodegroup-eviction
```

## Collector & Shipper Architecture

![](./docs/assets/overview.png)

This project provides a collector application, written in golang, which provides two applications:

- `Collector` - the collector application exposes a prometheus remote write API
  which can receive POST requests from prometheus in either v1 or v2 encoded
  format. It decodes the messages, then writes them to the `data` directory as
  Brotri-compressed JSON.
- `Shipper` - the shipper application watches the data directory looking for
  completed parquet files on a regular interval (eg. 10 min), then will call the
  `CloudZero upload API` to allocate S3 Presigned PUT URLS. These URLs are used
  to upload the file. The application has the ability to compress the files
  before sending them to S3.

## Message Format

The output of the _CloudZero Insights Controller_ application is a JSON object
that represents `cloudzero` metrics, which is POSTed to the CloudZero remote
write API. The format of these objects is based on the Prometheus `Timeseries`
protobuf message, defined
[here](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/main/prompb/types.proto#L122-L130).
Protobuf definitions for the `cloudzero` metrics are in the `proto/` directory.

There are four kinds of objects that can be sent:

1. **Pod metrics**

### Metric Names

- `cloudzero_pod_labels`
- `cloudzero_pod_annotations`

### Required Fields

- `__name__`; will be one of the valid pod metric names
- `namespace`; the namespace that the pod is launched in
- `resource_type`; will always be `pod` for pod metrics
