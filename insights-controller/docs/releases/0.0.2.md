## [0.0.2](https://github.com/Cloudzero/cloudzero-insights-controller/compare/v0.0.2...v0.0.1) (2024-11-17)

Various fixes and improvements, including more graceful retries and more granular control over what resources are gathered.

### Upgrade Steps

- N/A

### New Features

- **Granular Control of Resources Exported:** The types of Kubernetes resources for which labels and/or annotations are gathered can now be set per resource type. This improves performance on the initial scrape job.

### Bug Fixes

- **Context Deadline Issue Resolved:** A context timeout was causing timeout errors during the initial scrape job for clusters with relatively higher load. This context timeout was removed in favor of relying on the built-in kube client rate limiter.
- **Better Handling of Database Contention:** Processes that access the database should wait up to five seconds for the lock.

### Improvements

- **More Robust Retries for Remote Write:** Remote write requests to the CZ API use an exponential backoff for failed requests.
- **Faster Initial Scrape:** The initial scrape process is allowed to scrape data from the Kubernetes API at a faster rate.
