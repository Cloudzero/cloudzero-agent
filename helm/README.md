# CloudZero Collector / Shipper Development Helm Chart

This chart is used to deploy the CloudZero Collector and Shipper to a Kubernetes cluster. It is intended for development purposes and is not suitable for production environments, though the plan is to one day use it for the basis of a production-ready chart in the cloudzero-charts repository. It is being kept in this repository for now to make it easier to iterate as the collector and shipper evolve rapidly and we don't want to have to make PRs to two separate repositories.
