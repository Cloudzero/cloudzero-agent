## [0.2.1](https://github.com/Cloudzero/cloudzero-insights-controller/compare/v0.2.1...v0.2.0) (2025-03-28)

This is primarily a bug fix release, but also contains a number of updates and
improvements.

### Improvements

- **Additional testing**: A substantial number of tests have been added.
- **More robust build process**: The application can now be built from a
  directory named something other than "insights-controller".
- **Optional /debug/pprof/ endpoint**: If desired, you can enable profiling in
  order to better understand the performance characteristics of the application.
- **Configuratble destination URL for insight-controller app**: The
  `insight-controller` application now supports a configurable destination URL
  for metrics.

### Bug Fixes

- **Updated update logic**: An issue in which records could be sent multiple
  times is fixed. The logic for updating the `sent_at` time is simplified.
