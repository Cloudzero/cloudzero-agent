  # Run linters
  #
  # The primary linter we use here is golangci-lint, which is a linter framework
  # for Go which allows you to run a large number of linters to check for
  # specific issues.
  #
  # Note that we intentionally do not use the golangci-lint GitHub Action here
  # since there is a good chance it will get out of sync with the version used
  # in the Makefile. By using the version in the Makefile we make it easy to
  # make sure all developers are using the same version, and therefore finding
  # the same issues.

  # Run govulncheck
  #
  # govulncheck checks for known vulnerabilities in Go dependencies. Typically
  # it would make sense to run this in a separate pipeline, perhaps on a cron
  # job, because if it fails it will potentially "break" the CI builds for
  # issues unrelated to the commit in question. However, since govulncheck has
  # an extremely low rate of false positives (it checks if the vulnerable code
  # is actually used, as opposed to there just being a vulnerability somewhere
  # in the dependency), I think it is appropriate to force us to fix issues it
  # finds ASAP.
